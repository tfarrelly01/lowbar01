# lowbar01 - Lowbar Part 1
Re-implementation of various methods from the Underscore JS Library 


## Goal

The Lowbar01 project involves reimplementing core methods from the popular `Underscore JS` library as if I were its author. Part 1 re-implements the following:

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains
11. pluck
12. reduce
13. every
14. some
15. extends
16. defaults
